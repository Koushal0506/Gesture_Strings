# Gesture_Strings
The idea of this project is to develop an Air Guitar system using the GY-521  motion sensor, Arduino, and Python. The goal is to allow users to play guitar-like music without a physical instrument by using natural hand and wrist movements. The motion sensor is attached to the user’s wrist to detect tilt, orientation, and movement in real time.
